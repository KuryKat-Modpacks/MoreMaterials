## Getting Started

1. [Fork the repository](../../fork) to your GitHub account.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/MoreMaterials.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<minecraft-version>/<feature-name>
   ```

   **Rules for Branching:**

    * ALWAYS develop under the feat/ branch
    * `<minecraft-version>` needs to be the correct MC version, e.g. "1.19.2"
    * `<feature-name>` needs to be a valid feature name.
        * e.g. `fix-<issueID>`, which would then be the branch `feat/1.19.2/fix-45`
        * e.g. `cool-feature`, which would then the branch `feat/1.19.2/cool-feature`

4. Make your changes and commit them.
   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "<Emoji> <Type>([Scope]): <Message>"
   ```
    * Note: `([Scope])` is optional

   **Rules for Committing:**

    * All of your commits MUST follow
      the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) and MUST
      use [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev/)
        * **Project Specification**
            * ‚ú® = Feat
            * ‚ôªÔ∏è = Refactor
            * üêõ = Fix
            * üíö = CI (mostly the `.github` folder)
            * üë∑ = Chore (a.k.a. Build)
            * üìù = Docs
            * üß™ = Test
            * üé® = Style
            * üí• = Breaking Changes FOOTER (example below)
    * Those are the most common kinds of commits, but you might need a different one, check the Gitmojis website
      to find more emojis and the Conventional Commits for more types!

6. Submit a [Pull Request](../../pulls) to the main repository, explaining
   your changes and why they are valuable.

    * **Note:**
      You MUST target the *DEVELOPMENT* branch of the version you're working on when creating the PR, so for example if
      your
      develop branch was ``feat/1.19.2/cool-feature`` you will target the ``1.19.2/dev`` branch with your Pull Request.

## Code Style

Please ensure that your code follows the existing code style and conventions used in the project. I recommend using
IntelliJ IDEA as code formatter.

If you are adding new features or fixing bugs, it's essential to test your changes thoroughly. Ensure that your
contributions do not introduce new issues or break existing functionality.
